subtitle:  Self-managing Anycast Networks for DNS

== Problem:

The problem that SAND-3 addresses is that DNS operators have very few
intelligent real-time tools that enable them to monitor their anycast
services, for instance during a DDoS attack. The importance of proper
and informed management of anycast services has been highlighted by
the DDoS events targeting Brian Krebs's  website (Sep. 2016), OVH
(Sep. 2016) and Dyn (Oct. 2016), and the Root DNS system (Nov. 2015).
These attacks show a trend of extremely powerful DDoS attacks, using
IoT-based botnets and that can target not only commercial services,
but also critical Internet infrastructures, such as the DNS system.
DDoS attacks incur severe financial losses to target services.
However, most companies worry much more about the reputation damage of
having reachability and availability of their services compromised by
a DDoS. With intelligent tools operating in real-time, recovery from
an ongoing DDoS attack will be facilitated and accelerated, thus
reducing the initial impact of the attack on the reachability and
performance of the targeted service.
